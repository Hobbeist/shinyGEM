<h2>Background</h2>

In this repository we develop a bioconductor package for fast linear modelling of genetic/epigenetic data. This project is based on the 
<a href="https://github.com/fastGEM/GEM" target="blank_">*GEM*</a> (gene, environment, methylation) package, developed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27480116">Hong P. et al.(2016)</a>. 
The *GEM* package uses the <a href="https://github.com/andreyshabalin/MatrixEQTL" target="blank_">*MatrixEQTL*</a> package.  

We aim to build an easy to use package for wider application in the research community, enabling non-bioinformaticians to perform epigenome/genome wide association
studies. Further, this package contains the original GEM package functionality for exploration of methQTLs.
