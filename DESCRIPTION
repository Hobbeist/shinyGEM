Description: The shinyGEM package was developed for democratizing the application of epigenome wide association studies (EWAS).
  To perfrom an EWAS, usually bioinformatics expertise and especially knowledge of supercomputing or cloud computing is required on top of R expertise.
  With this package, we present a computationally efficient way of performing an EWAS on a laptop with >= 16 GB RAM. Further, we implemented
  an interactive shiny app, to make the application as seamless as possible, even for analyists with limited R knowledge
  This package is build on top of the Matrix eQTL by Andrey A. Shabalin
